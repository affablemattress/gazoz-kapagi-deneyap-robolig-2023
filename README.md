Repo made public after the competition.

We've used Turkish made ES32/ESP32-S2 dev boards, called Deneyap, to build a remote controlled land vehicle with an arm attachment in just under 18 hours.

P.S. The competition itself wasn't really that fun, don't recommend, 4/10 organization. But our team was awesome: <3 Hasan & Deniz
